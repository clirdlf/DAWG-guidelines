# Conclusion

The authors intend these guidelines not only to serve as your foundation for developing accessibility policies and procedures in an achievable way, but provide you with direction on how to put them into action. They may help you advocate for the importance of accessibility being factored into every stage of digital library work. Accessibility benefits everyone and is the foundation of usability. 

The preparation of this work is a volunteer effort. The community is grateful for all of the authorsâ€™ contributions.

# Enforceable Policies

Accessibility policies must not simply define best practices. They must be enforceable once put into practice. Policies must clearly communicate what is expected institution-wide regarding accessibility, and outline strategies that ensure these responsibilities are met. Furthermore, policies should mandate that these strategies be resourced and set up to succeed. 
Consider these factors:

-	[institutional context]({% link docs/putting-policy-into-practice/understanding-context.md %})
-	[obtaining support]({% link  docs/putting-policy-into-practice/obtaining-resources.md %})
-	[accessibility roles]({% link docs/putting-policy-into-practice/accessibility-roles.md %})
-	[adoption model]({% link docs/putting-policy-into-practice/models-of-adoption.md %})

# Enforceable Policies

Accessibility policies must not simply define best practices. They must be enforceable once put into practice. Policies must clearly communicate what is expected institution-wide regarding accessibility, and outline strategies that ensure these responsibilities are met. Furthermore, policies should mandate that these strategies be resourced and set up to succeed. 
Consider these factors:

-	institutional context [section 4.2]
-	obtaining support [section 4.3]
-	accessibility roles [section 4.4]
-	adoption model [section 4.5]

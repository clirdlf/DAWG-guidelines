## What Is a RACI chart?

A RACI chart is a project-management tool used to clarify responsibilities and roles when multiple team members are working on a complex project. Project participants are listed by role in Row 1. The tasks or stages comprised by a project are listed in Column 1. Within the chart, the nature of each participant/role’s responsibility for a given task is noted with  an R, A, C, or I. RACI stands for Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed. 

- **Responsible (R):** directly in charge of executing a project or one of its parts. 
- **Accountable (A):** accountable for a project’s completion and its outcomes. This may not be the person directly executing the work, and often is filled by a project manager overseeing progress, or an administrator shaping or overseeing a project. 
- **Consulted (C):** reviews a project or a task undertaken as a part of a project. 
- **Informed (I):** informed of a project’s progress and completion, but not directly involved in the work.

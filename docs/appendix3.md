## What Is a RACI chart?

A RACI chart is a project-management tool used to clarify responsibilities and roles when multiple team members are working on a complex project. Project participants are listed by role in Row 1. The tasks or stages comprised by a project are listed in Column 1. Within the chart, the nature of each participant/role’s responsibility for a given task is noted with  an R, A, C, or I. RACI stands for Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed. 

- **Responsible (R):** directly in charge of executing a project or one of its parts. 
- **Accountable (A):** accountable for a project’s completion and its outcomes. This may not be the person directly executing the work, and often is filled by a project manager overseeing progress, or an administrator shaping or overseeing a project. 
- **Consulted (C):** reviews a project or a task undertaken as a part of a project. 
- **Informed (I):** informed of a project’s progress and completion, but not directly involved in the work. 

## Digitization Workflow

|    | Accessibility point person | Project manager | Technical lead/developer | Metadata Creator | Collection Curator/ Project Sponsor | Digitization technician/ vendor |
|:---|:---------------------------|:----------------|:-------------------------|:-----------------|:------------------------------------|:--------------------------------|
|Assign accessibility work and ensures that there is appropriate time available to complete accessibility evaluation, testing, and fixing | C | R/A | C | I | I | C |
Executes technical work underlying project or product | C | C | R/A | C | C/I | C/I |
Attends to metadata considerations; consults on and/or implements accessible-metadata practices | C | I | C/I | R/A | C/I | R/A (if metadata is being created as part of vendor workflow) |
If digitization work is conducted by third-party vendor, provide accessibility guidance and quality review as work goes on  | R/A | I | C | C | I | C/I |
Evaluate and quality-checks digitization output for accessibility-standards compliance,either manually or through automatic tool testing. | R/A | I | C/I | C/I | C | I |
Works with staff or third- party vendors if fixes are needed in digital objects accompanying content, or metadata description. | R/A | C/I | I | C/I | C/I | C/I |

## Integrating Accessibility Tools Into Policies

Use this section to consider ways to integrate accessibility-oriented tools into your policies and the workflows they govern. 

It’s often not advisable to mandate the use of specific tools in top-level policies. A tool must be selected on the basis of technological and local considerations that are ever-shifting or may vary widely between individual projects. However, mandating the use of a specific tool type in a type of workflow can work well. For example, requiring  that all public-facing web pages are checked with a webpage checker, and tested with a screen reader, could be a viable way to encourage accessible tools.

Suggesting or mandating accessible practices through top-level policies is also an option. For example, mandating that meetings are recorded and transcribed through captioning software can be a good practice

## Identifying Accessibility Tools

Many tools are available for evaluating and improving the accessibility of one’s policies, and by extension, practices. These are constantly changing, as accessibility standards and digital technologies evolve. Refer to W3C’s [Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools List](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/tools/) for suggestions.

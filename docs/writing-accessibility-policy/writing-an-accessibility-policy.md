# Writing an Accessibility Policy

The Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) has excellent resources with detailed guidelines for developing accessibility policies. The following subsections refer to the basic policy structure: 

-	[Developing Organizational Policies on Web Accessibility][org policies]
-	[Developing an Accessibility Statement](statements), and
-	[Generating an Accessibility Statement for your Institution](https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/statements/generator/#create).

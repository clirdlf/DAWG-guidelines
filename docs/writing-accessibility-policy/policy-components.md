Specific information should be included in the policy that you share with the public, as well as additional information  in your internal procedures and workflows documentation. 

For an accessibility policy, the WAI outlines [what to include in an accessibility statement](https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/statements/): 

> â€œAccessibility statements should contain at least the following:
>   -	a commitment to accessibility for people with disabilities
>   -	the accessibility standard applied, such as WCAG 2.1
>   -	contact information in case people encounter problems
>
>   The following information is also advisable:
>
>   -	any known limitations, to avoid frustrating people
>   -	measures taken by your organization to ensure accessibility
>   -	technical prerequisites, such as supported web browsers
>   -	environments in which the content has been tested to work
>   -	references to applicable national or local laws and policies
>   -	a defined exception process that covers non-compliant solutions.
>
> Note that some situations may require you to provide particular content in your accessibility statements. For example, the EU Web Accessibility Directive [requirements for accessibility statements](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2018/1523/oj). (WAI, 2021, [Developing an Accessibility Statement](https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/statements/)). Additionally, federally funded programs or institutions must meet accessibility laws of [Section 508][Section 508] and the [Americans with  Disabilities Act (ADA)][ADA]; if state funded, check what accessibility requirements exist by state law.

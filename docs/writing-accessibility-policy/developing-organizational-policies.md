# Developing Organizational Policies

Beyond the accessibility policy statement, the WAI outlines these steps to follow, with detailed explanations, in its resource on [Developing Organizational Policies](https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/org-policies/) (2016):

> -	“[determine] Reference standards
> -	define conformance levels
> -	define scope of policy
> -	set conformance milestones
> -	consider third-party content
> -	define monitoring and review process
> -	next steps: Maintaining your policy
> -	longer term: Strategic planning” 

## What to Include in Policies and Procedures

In addition to what your accessibility policy should contain, we recommend that your policies and workflows should address these additional areas: 

-	the user experience
-	the digital content and associated metadata,
-	the authoring interface for staff or authorized users,
-	the content ingestion tools, 
-	the standards that the institution intends to follow, including remediation workflows.

## Accessibility Statement Generator Tool

If you don’t know where to start, the WAI has created a tool to [Generate an Accessibility Statement](https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/statements/generator/#create) for your Institution. Fill in the form fields to get a draft accessibility statement.
